# TON Labelling Side Quest Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for participating in the TON Foundation's address labelling side quest, which offers rewards of 5 TON per correctly labelled address.

## Overview

The TON Foundation is seeking help to identify the owners of TON blockchain addresses with notable on-chain activity. This is a separate task from the main DeDust dashboard contest but provides an opportunity to earn additional rewards.

## Reward

- **5 TON** per relevant labelled address that is accepted

## Goal

The goal is to tag addresses linked to TON-based businesses or apps. You are **not** required to uncover personal identities, only to identify which businesses or applications own particular addresses.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Notable Addresses

1. Visit the [TON Labelling Dashboard](https://dune.com/queries/1102089)
2. This dashboard lists addresses with significant on-chain activity that need identification
3. Look for addresses with high transaction counts, large volumes, or interesting patterns

### Step 2: Research the Addresses

For each address you want to label, you'll need to gather evidence:

1. **Direct Confirmation** (ONE of the following):
   - Screenshot from a mini app showing the address in use
   - Clear mention of the address in the project's official social media
   - Official documentation that references the address

2. **OR Indirect Confirmation** (TWO of the following):
   - Transaction patterns that match known behavior of the service
   - Consistent interaction with other known addresses
   - On-chain data that strongly suggests ownership
   - Community recognition of the address's purpose

### Step 3: Submit Labels via Pull Request

1. Go to the [TON Labels Repo](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-labels)
2. Fork the repository
3. Add your labels to the appropriate files
4. Create a pull request with your changes

### Step 4: Include Required Information

In your pull request, make sure to include:

1. The address you're labelling
2. The label you're assigning (e.g., "DeDust: Router Contract")
3. Evidence supporting your label (direct or indirect confirmations)
4. Your TON wallet address (for receiving the reward)
5. Your Telegram handle or email for contact

## Research Techniques

### 1. Examine Transaction Patterns

Look at:
- Who the address interacts with
- Types of operations performed
- Timing and frequency of transactions
- Value transferred in transactions

### 2. Check Official Sources

- Project documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Official Telegram channels
- Twitter accounts
- Medium articles

### 3. Use Block Explorers

- [TON Explorer](https://explorer.ton.org/)
- [TonScan](https://tonscan.org/)
- [TonWhales Explorer](https://tonwhales.com/explorer)

### 4. Community Resources

- Telegram groups
- Discord servers
- Forum discussions

## Example Submission

Here's an example of what a good submission looks like:

```
Address: EQCkR1cGmnsE45N4K0otPl5EnxnRakmGqeJUNua5fkWhales
Label: TON Whales: Main Service Wallet

Evidence:
1. Direct confirmation: Screenshot from the TON Whales website showing this address as their main service wallet (attached image: tonwhales_screenshot.png)

OR

2. Indirect confirmations:
   a. Regular interaction with known TON Whales staking pool addresses
   b. Transaction pattern matches TON Whales' described service operations in their documentation

TON Wallet for reward: EQD_YourWalletAddressHere_123456789
Contact: @your_telegram_handle
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Focus on active projects**: Addresses belonging to popular DeFi protocols, exchanges, or games are good targets
2. **Look for patterns**: Many services have recognizable transaction patterns
3. **Check social media**: Many projects announce their contract addresses on Telegram or Twitter
4. **Be thorough**: Provide clear, convincing evidence for your labels
5. **Quality over quantity**: A few well-documented labels are better than many poorly-researched ones

## Potential Address Sources for DeDust

Since you're already researching DeDust for the main contest, you might want to look for:

1. DeDust router contract addresses
2. DeDust factory contract addresses
3. DeDust liquidity pool addresses
4. DeDust treasury or fee collection addresses
5. DeDust developer/team addresses

## Submission Deadline

Submit your labels before the contest deadline: **March 24, 2023**
